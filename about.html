                    The name, Magic Squirrel Games, is based on the gamertag created by Evan at a young age, which itself
                    is based upon the "magic squirrels" in children's book series "Origami Yoda". The name "Magic Squirrel"
                    was already taken, so two zeroes were placed in between the two words to create the username "magic00squirrel".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This name is the one curently used by Evan's personal YouTube channel and was adapted and modified
                    to create the name under which his games would be published. Thus Magic Squirrel Games was born.
