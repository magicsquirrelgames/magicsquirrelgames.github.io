        <h1>What is Magic Squirrel Games?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Magic Squirrel Games is an indie game publishing and development company run and established by Evan Yang. 
            My goal is to create fun and simple games that bring the best out of gaming: entertaining, 
            memorable games with create mechanics and unique art styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also run a YouTube channel of the same name, in which I hope to provide fascinating insight
            into behind-the-scenes game development as well as informative tutorials to help aspiring
            game developers. Game updates and development logs will also be frequently posted onto this channel,
            allowing you to keep up to date on the latest projects in the works from Magic Squirrel Games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Games published by Magic Squirrel Games are usually made in the Unity game engine and are coded in C#.
            Projects I have in the works will be published to a variety of platforms, including mobile, PC, and console.
            The platforms that a game will be available for vary from game to game and are chosen based on the control scheme
            that is the most intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Magic Squirrel Games and its products are in the very early stages of development, and need your help
            to make this project the best it can possibly be. Every game developer can benefit from feedback and
            playtesting, no matter how experienced they are. For feedback regarding games, such as bug reports and feature
            requests, or feedback regarding the YouTube channel and its tutorials, please contact me at feedback@magicsquirrelgames.com.
            For buisness inquires, such as collaborations, please contact buisness@magicsquirrelgames.com.

                <p>In this video I'm showing off a work in progress attachment system for my Comic Book Inspired Unity FPS game.</p>
                <p>
                    The game will feature small scale stealth and action first-person-shooter combat. Styled after
                    traditional comic books and 2D animation, the game uses techniques such as cel shading, 
                    outlines, and ben-day bloom to create a unique art style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gameplay is inspired from games like Trepang2, Call of Duty, and Metal Gear Solid, 
                    and will feature time control mechanics and advanced movement options.

        <h1>Snowboard Penguin releases December 2024</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/banner-snowboard-penguin.png" class="banner">
        <p>
            The first game published by Magic Squirrel games will be arriving in December 2024. 
            This fun and addictive christmas themed game will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices.
            Snowboard Penguin is inspired by the classic, high intensity, pick-up-and-play gameplay and scoring
            system of many arcade games. You play as a thrill-seeking, adrenaline junky penguin on a snowboarding trip
            high in the mountains. The farther you go, the harder it gets. How far can you make it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time you play you'll gain XP points which go towards leveling up. Leveling up rewards with a present
            which can be opened to unlock cool cosmetics to deck out your penguin with. Mix and match
            these cosmetics in the main menu and send you penguin out with style! Unwanted cosmetics can be recycled
            into puzzle pieces which can be turned into even rarer and cooler hats, trails, and snowboards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Snowboard Penguin will be available to download for free on iOS and Android in December 2024!
