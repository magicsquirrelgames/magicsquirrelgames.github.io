                <hr>
                <p>
                    Magic Squirrel Games is an indie game publishing and development company run by game 
                    developer and enthusiast Evan Yang. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to create fun and simple games that bring the best out of gaming: entertaining, 
                    memorable games with create mechanics and unique art styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also run a YouTube channel of the same name, in which I hope to provide fascinating insight
                    into behind-the-scenes game development as well as informative tutorials to help aspiring
                    game developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Magic Squirrel Games is in the very early stages of development, and I want your help to make
                    this project the best it can be. For feedback on games and the YouTube channel please contact me

                <p>In this video I'm showing off a work in progress attachment system for my Comic Book Inspired Unity FPS game.</p>
                <p>
                    The game will feature small scale stealth and action first-person-shooter combat. Styled after
                    traditional comic books and 2D animation, the game uses techniques such as cel shading, 
                    outlines, and ben-day bloom to create a unique art style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gameplay is inspired from games like Trepang2, Call of Duty, and Metal Gear Solid, 
                    and will feature time control mechanics and advanced movement options.

                    You play as a thrill-seeking, adrenaline junky penguin on a snowboarding trip
                    high in the mountains. The farther you go, the harder it gets. How far can you make it?
                 </p>
