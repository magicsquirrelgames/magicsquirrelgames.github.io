            <h1>What is Magic Squirrel Games?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Magic Squirrel Games is an indie game publishing and development company run by game 
                developer and enthusiast Evan Yang. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to create fun and simple games that bring the best out of gaming: entertaining, 
                memorable games with interesting mechanics and unique art styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magic Squirrel Games also has a YouTube channel, with which I hope to provide fascinating insight
                into behind-the-scenes game development, as well as informative tutorials to help aspiring
                game developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magic Squirrel Games is in the very early stages of development, and I want your help to make
                this project the best it can be. Please feel free to reach out to me at:

                <p>
                    The first game published by Magic Squirrel games will be arriving in February 2025! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This fun and addictive Christmas themed game will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices.
                    Snowboard Penguin is inspired by the classic, high intensity, pick-up-and-play gameplay and scoring
                    system of many arcade games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You play as a thrill-seeking, adrenaline-junkie penguin on a snowboarding trip
                    high in the mountains. The farther you go, the steeper the slopes. How far can you make it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Snowboard Penguin will be available to download for free on iOS and Android in December 2024!
